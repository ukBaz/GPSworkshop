<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this workshop you will use the Raspberry Pi (RPi) to control a board that contains</P>
<p align=center>
<img src="images/H13467_connections.jpg"alt="Workstation connected up" width=80%>
</p>

<p>
This workshop will show you how to:
<ul>
<li>Sense when the button has been pressed</li>
<li>Capture a coordinate from the GPS module</li>
<li>Display the distance from that point</li>
<li>You can then experiment with adding your own functionality</li>
</ul>
</p>

This workshop uses the Python programming language to do the coding. Python is a 
language that was designed to be easy to read and easy to learn, and so is ideal for 
beginners and experts alike. 
There are also lots of resources available where you can find more information on 
what you have learnt today.
As GPS devices works best outdoors so once the coding is finished we will take our 
hardware outside and measure

<h2>Audience Expectations:</h2>
It is expected that you will have some experience of using a Raspberry Pi (or similar) 
and some Python coding.
Not to worry if you don't fit that description as the steps are explained in the 
workshop and there are people on hand to help.
<h2>Goal:</h2>
We will use some existing software modules along with a little of our own code to 
end up with a system that will allow us to measure distances in metres.
 <h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>

In this workshop you will be working in a Linux Operating system environment. This 
is an alternative to Microsoft Windows popular with all types of Engineers.
Linux commands are indicated by lines starting with; >
<pre>
> The commands for you to type, or text you will see in 
the Linux Terminal, are in this bold text, and have a > 
at the beginning (don't type this)
</pre>
<p id="emphesis">Logging into the Raspberry Pi:</p>
When the RPi starts up you will be prompted to log in. The details are:
<pre>
> User: pi
> Password: raspberry
</pre>
<p id="emphesis">Getting a graphical desktop:</p>
<p>Once you have logged in you will need to start the graphical desktop. This can be 
done by typing;</p>
<pre>> startx</pre>
<p id="emphesis">Getting a Linux command prompt:</p>
<p>Once the desktop has started click on the menus to open an "LXTerminal" which is a 
Linux command prompt window.</p>
<p align=center>
<img src="images/LXterminal_pick.jpg"alt="Workstation connected up" width=50%>
</p>
 
<p id="emphesis">Some basic Linux commands:</p>
<p>Change to the directory where the Python libraries are that we will use;</p>
<pre>
> cd python/GPS
</pre>
<p>
This is where we will run our python script from; more on this in a minute.<br>
To list the contents of the is directory type; </p>
<pre>
> ls 
</pre>
<p>
To be able to see the sizes of the files in human readable format, type; </p>
<pre>
> ls -lh
</pre>
<p align=center>
  <img src="images/ls_in_term.jpg"alt="Long listing of directory" width=70%>
</p>

<p id="emphesis">Starting the Python Integrated Development Environment (idle):</p>
<p>On the command line type; </p>
<pre>
> sudo idle -e myGPS.py
</pre>
 

<p>"sudo" means we are running as a Super User which we will need so that we have 
access to the GPIO pins. myGPS.py is the name of the file where we will store our 
code.</p>
<h2>Import:</h2>
<p>Python scripts can import code from modules. It is customary but not required to 
place all import statements at the beginning of a script. Sometimes we will import 
whole modules and at other times we will just import certain functions from a module 
e.g. the sleep function from within the time module.</p>
<h2>While loop:</h2>
<p>We are going to use a while loop to continuously repeat our code. So we can break 
out of the loop with some degree of control we are going to use "try, except and 
finally" functionality of Python to capture us breaking out of the loop with a CTRL-C 
and tidy up before we exit the script.</p>
<h2>Object Orientated:</h2>
<p>We are going to instantiate objects such as BTN (button), LD1 (LED 1), LD2 (LED 
2), GPS1 (GPS device) and DISP (display on the circuit board). This will allow us to 
read attributes and methods of those objects.</p>
<h2>Distance Calculator:</h2>
<p>Now enter the following code into the IDLE text editor you started. This is the code 
for a distance calculator that will run on the circuit board using the RPi and the CSR 
GPS chip.
</p>

<h2>Testing Your Code:</h2>
<p>When you are ready to run your code;
<ul>
<li>Save your code (File menu)</li>
<li>Run Module from the IDLE Run menu (or you could use the F5 key)</li>
<ul><li>This will run your code so you can test it and debug it</li></ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p align=center>
  <img src="images/run_idle.jpg"alt="Run Code From IDLE" width=70%>
</p>

<p>
When you run this code you will see output on your monitor (from the "print" 
statements in the code), and also on the display on the circuit board (from the 
DISP.setMsg statements in the code).</p>

<p>Debugging your code means to test it and find any errors that prevent it running as 
you would like it to, or in fact not running at all!</p>

<p>Debugging tips;
<ul>
  <li>Do you have syntax errors? </li>
    <ul><li>If so the problem code will be highlighted by the debugger to help you 
find your problem. Try checking your spelling, spaces, and tabs.</li></ul>
  <li>No syntax errors, but errors while running the code?
    <ul><li>The debugger will help you by telling you what line of code it thinks 
the problem is on. You can find what line of the code you are on by 
looking in the bottom right corner of the text editor.</li></ul>
  <li>When running your code try pushing the button on the circuit board and see if 
the display changes, or if you get any further errors.</li>
</li></ul>
</p>
<p id="emphesis">Before taking our build outside:</p>
<p>Before we can take hardware outside we need to ensure our code will run 
automatically as we will not have a screen and keyboard outside.
We will make this happen by using the Linux capabilities of "crontab". 
Crontab executes scripts at specific times or in our case, at boot up.
To edit the crontab use the following command on the Linux prompt; </p>
<pre>> crontab -e </pre>

<p>And add the following line to the file;</p>
<pre>
@reboot sudo python /home/pi/python/GPS/myGPS.py
</pre>

<p>Make sure that the file name is the same as the one you saved your work in. Save the 
changes to the crontab. </p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> there are command instructions at the bottom of the crontab window showing 
you how to save this. ^ in Linux means the Ctrl button so ^O means hold down the 
Ctrl button and press O.</p>

<h2>Testing Outside:</h2>
<p>Once you have finished debugging your code, and updated the crontab then we can 
take our hardware outside.
<ul>
<li>Close all windows and logout of the RPi</li>
<li>Ask for help with unplugging the circuit board, and correctly configuring the 
battery.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>What will you measure?</p>
<div id=header>
<P CLASS="pagebreak"></p>
<h1>Appendix 1: Additional Challenges</h1>
</div>
<p>If you finish building the tape measure maybe you want to create some new code to 
display other properties of the GPS module.</p>

<h2>Displaying the time from the GPS module:</h2>
<p>There is a method in the GPS class to get the time with a local time offset. This 
method is called get_local_clock().
Here is an example of how this function might be used:<br>
<pre>
gps_time = GPS1.get_local_clock()
print 'Show time: {0}'.format(gps_time)
DISP.show_clock(gps_time)
</pre>
</p>
<p>To show the time on the display we recommend using show_clock() rather than 
show_msg() as this will give you a colon ":" between the hours and minutes.
The time by default will be GMT so if we were on BST you would need to change the 
time zone with the set_time_zone_offset method. An example of this is:<br>
<pre>GPS1.set_time_zone_offset(1)</pre></p>

<h2>Number of Satellites Visible</h2>
<p>The GPS module stores how many GPS and GLONASS satellites are in view (siv) in 
the variables gps_siv and glo_siv respectively. 
You may want to show this information on your display. An example of getting and 
displaying these variables is:<br>
<pre>print 'Show satellite count {0:02}:{1:02}'.format(GPS1.gps_siv, GPS1.glo_siv)
DISP.show_clock('{0:02}{1:02}'.format(GPS1.gps_siv, GPS1.glo_siv))
</pre></p>
In this example we have used the show_clock method so that we get the colon 
between the two numbers. You can also use the show_msg command.

<h2>Show Coarse Over Ground</h2>
<p>The GPS module stores the direction it calculates we are travelling with respect to 
true north in a variable called cog. This is an integer in degrees clockwise from true 
north.
An example of how to retrieve and display this is:<br>
<pre>
print 'Show Course over Ground: {0}'.format(GPS1.cog)
DISP.show_msg('{0}'.format(GPS1.cog))
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Show Altitude</h2>
<p>The GPS module stores the altitude in a variable called alt_msl. MSL stands for Mean 
Sea Level. MSL is defined as the zero elevation for a local area. Unfortunately for 
mapmakers, sea level is not a simple surface as the sea surface conforms to the earth's 
gravitational field so there is a lively debate about what should be the zero elevation. 
We shall ignore this for now and look to see what the reading is for where we are.
An example of how to retrieve and display this is:<br>
<pre>print 'Show Altitude {0}'.format(GPS1.alt_msl)
DISP.show_msg('{0}'.format(GPS1.alt_msl))
</pre>
